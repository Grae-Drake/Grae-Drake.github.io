&lt;h2 id="counting-primes">Counting Primes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s start by looking at each integer, deciding whether it&amp;rsquo;s prime, and counting it if it is until we get to the 10,001st prime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our first stab at an &lt;code>is_prime(n)&lt;/code> function will be the simplest and we&amp;rsquo;ll iterate into more optimized (and complicated) versions after. Here&amp;rsquo;s the starting point:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">def is_prime(n):
if n &amp;lt; 2:
return False
for x in range(2, n):
if n % x == 0:
return False
return True
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This checks every number less than $ n $ to see if it&amp;rsquo;s a factor of $ n $. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>almost&lt;/em> good enough to solve the problem in under a minute. My laptop chugs through the first 10,001 primes in 68 seconds using this version of the &lt;code>is_prime(n)&lt;/code> function (full code later). But the rules only give us a minute and we can do better.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cap-the-search-space">Cap the Search Space&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Looking back at our
&lt;a href="https://www.grae.io/post/euler_problem_3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Problem 3 Solution&lt;/a> we optimized our &lt;code>is_prime(n)&lt;/code> function by caping the space we search to find factors factors by checking only numbers up to $ \sqrt{n} $. Check out that post if you want to dig deep into why / how that works.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">def is_prime(n):
if n &amp;lt; 2:
return False
for x in range(2, math.floor(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
if n % x == 0:
return False
return True
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This runs a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> faster. It finds the 10,001st prime in 0.29 seconds on my machine. But can we make it &lt;em>even better&lt;/em>?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="skip-through-the-search-space">Skip Through the Search Space&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://primes.utm.edu/notes/faq/six.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perhaps the most rediscovered result about primes numbers&lt;/a> is the fact that every prime bigger than 3 is &amp;ldquo;next&amp;rdquo; to a multiple of 6. That is, for every prime number starting at 5 you can get a multiple of 6 by adding 1 or subtracting 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>5 is prime, add 1 and get 6&lt;/li>
&lt;li>13 is prime, subtract 1 and get (6 * 2)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1,361 is prime, add 1 and get (6 * 227)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This works for every prime number.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can use this property to skip potential factors we don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>need&lt;/em> to check. When checking to see if a number $ n $ has factors we can get away with just looking for the prime factors, we don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>also&lt;/em> need to know if it has any factors that are themselves composite. For example, we don&amp;rsquo;t need to know that 24 is divisible by 8. We can stop as soon as we see it&amp;rsquo;s divisible by 2. So we can skip every potential factor except for those which &lt;em>might&lt;/em> be prime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In code:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">def is_prime(n):
if n &amp;lt; 2:
return False
if n == 2 or n == 3:
return True
if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
return False
for x in range(6, math.floor(math.sqrt(n)) + 2, 6):
if n % (x - 1) == 0 or n % (x + 1) == 0:
return False
return True
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This version takes advantage of Python&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;step&amp;rdquo; argument to &lt;code>range()&lt;/code>. We&amp;rsquo;re looking at every multiple of 6 (below our limit) and checking whether the number before or after it divides our target.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This optimizes things a bit more and, indeed, finds the 10,001st prime in 0.17 seconds on my machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="putting-it-together">Putting it Together&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once we have an efficient &lt;code>is_prime()&lt;/code> function the solution is a matter of counting primes with a while loop.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">seen = 0
n = 1
while seen &amp;lt; 10001:
n += 1
if is_prime(n):
seen += 1
print(n)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="going-further">Going Further&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are ways to solve this problem even faster. You &lt;em>could&lt;/em> use the

We&amp;rsquo;ll deal with those concepts in coming problems so for now I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that as an exercise for the reader.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Project Euler Problem 5: Smallest Multiple</title><link>/post/euler_problem_5/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2020 10:33:17 -0600</pubDate><guid>/post/euler_problem_5/</guid><description>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Problem 5&lt;/a> is a lot of fun (well, &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo;) because (1) there&amp;rsquo;s a very simple program requiring no math that calculates the answer, but (2) that program would need impossible amounts of compute to actually run, and (3) you can figure the answer with pen and paper super fast if you think about the math a bit. That&amp;rsquo;s what normal people consider fun, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since this problem leans much more on number theory than on programming we&amp;rsquo;ll use it as an excuse to talk about math more than usual. Our first real step into number theory was
&lt;a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Problem 3&lt;/a> (
&lt;a href="grae.io/post/euler_problem_3/">blog post&lt;/a>) with prime factors. Here we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about least common multiples and prime factorization. This will be useful: as we get deeper into Project Euler we&amp;rsquo;ll get much deeper into number theory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As always, spend some time with
&lt;a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Problem 5&lt;/a> on your own if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="brute-force">Brute Force?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Each Project Euler problem has basically two parts: an example and a problem statement. In this case the example is:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>These examples are crazy useful. They aren&amp;rsquo;t just there to define the problem: they let us work through the problem with simpler, smaller inputs. Testing and tinkering with small examples can yield insights, concepts, and strategies that help solve the problem with tougher inputs. They&amp;rsquo;re hints; if you look at them hard enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, as a programmer your instinct might be to throw piles of compute at this problem. The example number is pretty small (just 2,520). Maybe we can just light up a few nested loops to chew through this?&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">found = False
n = 1
factors = range(1, 11)
while not found:
found = True
for x in factors:
if n % x != 0:
found = False
if found:
print(i)
n += 1
print(n)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>That program gives &lt;code>2520&lt;/code> with no appreciable delay. Let&amp;rsquo;s crank our range up to 20 and try it out!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yeah so I pulled the plug after taking more than a minute to iterate all the way up to &lt;code>19034074&lt;/code> without finding the answer. Clearly the number we&amp;rsquo;re looking for is too big to find with this brute force approach. Looks like we&amp;rsquo;re going to &lt;em>have&lt;/em> to think about the math a bit.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="break-out-the-pen-and-paper">Break Out the Pen and Paper&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If we can&amp;rsquo;t brute force our way, there must be a more direct solution. This is where Project Euler&amp;rsquo;s hints are crazy useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One way to calculate a number that&amp;rsquo;s divisible by a set of factors (a &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>common multiple&lt;/strong>&amp;quot;) is to just multiply the factors all together. In our example case that&amp;rsquo;s:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 * 7 * 8 * 9 * 10 $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s cumbersome to write out, so instead I&amp;rsquo;ll use $ ! $, which is short hand for the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">factorial operation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We see that $ 10! $ is $ 3{,}628{,}800 $. That&amp;rsquo;s MUCH bigger than $ 2{,}520 $. Exactly $ 1{,}440 $ times bigger in fact. What&amp;rsquo;s so special about $ 1{,}440 $? And why can you evenly divide it by 2 and 3 so many times?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, &lt;em>you know&lt;/em> that every integer is either prime or the product of prime factors. You &lt;em>may not&lt;/em> know that&amp;rsquo;s called the &amp;ldquo;unique factorization theorem&amp;rdquo;, or, with more gravitas, the &amp;ldquo;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fundamental theorem of arithmetic&lt;/a>&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finding the prime factors of a number is called &lt;strong>prime factorization&lt;/strong> and it can take a long time with big numbers. But you can factorize all the numbers you need to solve this problem in your head because they&amp;rsquo;re all so small.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tinkering with a calculator and without needing to write any code, we can see that the prime factors of $ 1{,}440 $ are:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ [2{,\ }2{,\ }2{,\ }2{,\ }2{,\ }3{,\ }3{,\ }5] $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You could say that each of those is an &amp;ldquo;extra&amp;rdquo; factor and that $ 10! $ has a bunch of extra factors of $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ and $ 5 $ compared to the least common multiple. This is even clearer if we set the prime factorization of the least common multiple (&amp;ldquo;LCM&amp;rdquo;) and $ 10! $ next to each other:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ LCM = 2{,}520 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^1 * 7^1 $$
$$ 10! = 3{,}628{,}800 = 2^8 * 3^4 * 5^2 * 7^1 $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Progress! Is there a way we can figure out (1) which prime numbers are factors of our answer and (2) how many of each prime is &amp;ldquo;enough&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="which-prime-numbers">Which Prime Numbers?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Looking at the example we see none of the prime factors are larger than 10. And that every prime number less than 10 is represented at least once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This makes sense. The next largest prime number, 11, isn&amp;rsquo;t a factor of any of the numbers 1-10. And &lt;em>every&lt;/em> number, &lt;em>including each prime number&lt;/em>, less than 10 is a factor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we know that our answer has every prime number less than 20 as a factor at least once, and none of the prime numbers larger than 20 as a factor.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-many-of-each">How many of each?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Some of the primes from 2 to 19 have to be represented more than once. We know that because &lt;em>that number&lt;/em> (9,699,690) would have been found with our brute force approach if it were correct. We also know that because a number like 4, which has two factors of 2, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t evenly divide it. And 8, which has &lt;em>three&lt;/em> factors of two &lt;em>also&lt;/em> wouldn&amp;rsquo;t evenly divide it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out that we need &amp;ldquo;enough&amp;rdquo; of each prime to make every one of the factors (1 to 20). Looking at the answer to the example, it needs &lt;em>three&lt;/em> factors of 2 because it needs to be divisible by 8. And it needs &lt;em>two&lt;/em> factors of 3 because it needs to be divisible by 9. But only &lt;em>one&lt;/em> factor of the larger primes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="coding-a-solution">Coding a solution&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At this point it might actually be easier to break out a pen and tally the answer. You could do that by looking at each number from 1 to 20, calculating the prime factors for each number, keeping the largest count of each prime factor, and then multiplying out everything. But instead, let&amp;rsquo;s write some code to do that!&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">from math import floor
# A simple function to test whether a number is prime.
def is_prime(n):
for x in range(2, floor(n ** 0.5) + 1):
if n % x == 0:
return False
return True
# The number we'll check up to. Set to 10 to test the code then change to 20.
limit = 100
# A list of primes we know show up at least once.
primes = [x for x in range(2, limit + 1) if is_prime(x)]
# A simple function to calculate the prime factors of a number.
def prime_factors(n):
result = {prime: 0 for prime in primes}
i = 0
for prime in primes:
while n % prime == 0:
result[prime] += 1
n = n / prime
return result
# Initialize factors. We know each prime below limit shows up at least once.
factors = {prime: 1 for prime in primes}
# Look at the prime counts for each number in our range and keep the highest.
for x in range(2, limit + 1):
for prime, count in prime_factors(x).items():
factors[prime] = max(count, factors[prime])
# Calculate and print the result.
result = 1
for prime, count in factors.items():
result *= prime ** count
print(result)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>There are ways to further optimize this solution. For example, you could sidestep the need for a &lt;code>prime_factors()&lt;/code> function altogether with witty application of some logarithms and the observation that 3 * 3 * 3 is bigger than 20. But that feels a bit silly. Even bumping up our limit to 100 and running this program it calculates the 41-digit answer without noticeable delay.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Project Euler Problem 4: Largest palindrome product</title><link>/post/euler_problem_4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 May 2020 18:41:21 -0700</pubDate><guid>/post/euler_problem_4/</guid><description>&lt;p>Project Euler
&lt;a href="projecteuler.net/problem=4">problem 4&lt;/a> feels like a step back in difficulty. The numbers involved aren&amp;rsquo;t too big so we don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about resource constraints. The subproblems it breaks down into are fairly straightforward. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet, take some time with this problem on your own and continue on down below.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="breaking-the-problem-down">Breaking the Problem Down&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We can break this problem down into several subproblems:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Be able to check whether a number is a &amp;ldquo;palindrome&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Look at the right set of numbers and check whether each is a palindrome&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Choose the right one from the final set&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="subproblem-1-the-is_palindromen-function">Subproblem 1: The &lt;code>is_palindrome(n)&lt;/code> Function&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the first subproblem and write an &lt;code>is_palindrome(n)&lt;/code> function to check whether a number is a palindrome. This function uses arithmetic to create a new integer with the digits of &lt;code>n&lt;/code> reversed&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">def is_palindrome(n):
backwards = 0
temp = n
while temp &amp;gt; 0:
backwards *= 10
backwards += temp % 10
temp = temp // 10
return backwards == n
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>There are several ways you could define this &lt;code>is_palindrome(n)&lt;/code> function. You might prefer to use strings rather than arithmetic:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">def is_palindrome(n):
return str(n) == str(n)[::-1]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This one uses Python&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/2.3/whatsnew/section-slices.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended slicing&lt;/a>, one of my favorite Python features. Slicing makes Python a joy to work with.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="subproblem-2-generating-products">Subproblem 2: Generating Products&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>How can we generate the set of numbers we need to check? We&amp;rsquo;re interested in all the products of two 3-digit numbers. We can use a simple &lt;code>for&lt;/code> loop to generate each 3-digit number. To generate all &lt;em>pairs&lt;/em> of 3-digit numbers we can nest two &lt;code>for&lt;/code> loops:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">products = []
for x in range(100, 1000):
for y in range(100, 1000):
products.append(x * y)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The nested &lt;code>for&lt;/code> loops above will generate every
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permutation&lt;/a> (specifically, the &amp;ldquo;permutation with repetition&amp;rdquo; or
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cartesian product&lt;/a>) of three digit numbers, use those factors to calculate the product, and add that product to a list of all products.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Python has a &lt;em>wonderful&lt;/em> standard library. The &lt;code>itertools&lt;/code> module (
&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docs&lt;/a>) is particularly useful for Project Euler problems with how often it throws combinatorics problems at us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is the same solution using &lt;code>itertools.product&lt;/code> and a list comprehension:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">from itertools import product
factor_pairs = product(range(100, 1000), repeat=2)
products = [factors[0] * factors[1] for factors in factor_pairs]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="speeding-up-with-combinations">Speeding up with Combinations&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The approach above using products will make us duplicate some of our work. For example, $ 101 * 202 $ is the same as $ 202 * 101 $, and the approach above calculates that product ($ 20{,}402 $) multiple times. Wasted compute cycles, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter much for this problem because the numbers are small enough to just power through, but it&amp;rsquo;s easy to imagine a situation where unnecessarily repeating work &lt;em>does&lt;/em> cause problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because the order of factors doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, we can use a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combination&lt;/a> rather than a product to find all the products we want. We&amp;rsquo;ll skip straight to the &lt;code>itertools&lt;/code> solution this time:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">from itertools import combinations_with_replacement
factor_pairs = combinations_with_replacement(range(100, 1000), r=2)
products = [factors[0] * factors[1] for factors in factor_pairs]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This approach cuts the length of &lt;code>products&lt;/code> about in half because it isn&amp;rsquo;t unnecessarily repeating calculations. That&amp;rsquo;s not critical for this problem, but being aware of these issues will help us down the road.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="subproblem-3-finding-the-correct-product">Subproblem 3: Finding the Correct Product&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve generated every product we want and stored them in a &lt;code>products&lt;/code> list and have a &lt;code>is_palindrome(n)&lt;/code> function we can filter down to just palindromic numbers:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">palindromes = [product for product in products if is_palindrome(product)]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>From there we can sort and take the largest palindrome:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">print(sorted(palindromes)[-1])
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This approach uses Python&amp;rsquo;s built-in &lt;code>sorted()&lt;/code> function (
&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docs&lt;/a>) and looks at the end of the list for the biggest value.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="can-you-improve-it">Can you Improve it?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The solution described here generates &lt;em>all&lt;/em> products of 3-digit numbers, even the small ones we know probably aren&amp;rsquo;t the answer. The nested for loops above count &lt;em>up&lt;/em> through all the factors to generate products and then palindromes. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to write a solution that counts &lt;em>down&lt;/em> and finds the answer with much less compute than the solution in this post. Can you figure out how?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Project Euler Problem 3: Largest Prime Factor</title><link>/post/euler_problem_3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 12:50:20 -0700</pubDate><guid>/post/euler_problem_3/</guid><description>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Problem 3&lt;/a> is where Euler starts forcing us to consider resource limitations. Before, the most straightforward solution worked just fine, even if it used more resources than a less complex algorithm would. As we&amp;rsquo;ll see here, that kind of solution, while &lt;em>correct&lt;/em> doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for us because the program never finishes in a reasonable amount of time. If we&amp;rsquo;re going to solve this one we need to start thinking about algorithmic complexity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As usual, this is a good chance to take some time with the problem yourself before continuing on.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="the-straightforward-naive-approach">The Straightforward (Naive) Approach&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So far I&amp;rsquo;ve been super intentional about saying &amp;ldquo;straightforward&amp;rdquo; when talking about the first solution that comes to mind. A lot of people call this the &amp;ldquo;naive&amp;rdquo; solution. I understand why people say &amp;ldquo;naive&amp;rdquo; but I usually avoid that word because I don&amp;rsquo;t like the negative connotations it carries. As we&amp;rsquo;ve seen, sometimes the &amp;ldquo;naive&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;straightforward&amp;rdquo; solution really is the &lt;em>best&lt;/em> solution: it really depends on your context and the tradeoffs you&amp;rsquo;re making. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people internalize the principle that the straightforward solution &lt;em>must be&lt;/em> a &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; solution and refuse to consider the tradeoffs involved. In the real world that mindset will just &lt;em>kill&lt;/em> your productivity and lead you to produce work that isn&amp;rsquo;t appropriate for the context you&amp;rsquo;re working in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That said, there are situations where it&amp;rsquo;s easier to call a solution &amp;ldquo;naive&amp;rdquo; and this problem gives us a good example. My first attempt at solving this problem went like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Ok, let&amp;rsquo;s just iterate over every number between 1 and 600,851,475,143, test whether it&amp;rsquo;s prime, then if so test whether it&amp;rsquo;s a factor of 600,851,475,143. Finally take the biggest one and there&amp;rsquo;s your answer.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In code that would look something like this. Ignore the magic &lt;code>is_prime()&lt;/code> function for now, we&amp;rsquo;ll get to that further down:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">factors = []
for x in range(2, 600851475143):
if is_prime(x):
if 600851475143 % x == 0:
factors.append(x)
print(factors[-1])
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now, it&amp;rsquo;s important to note that this solution is &lt;em>correct&lt;/em>. We can test it on the example the problem gives us (&lt;code>13195&lt;/code>) and we get the right answer (&lt;code>29&lt;/code>). And we get it fast: running it on my machine there&amp;rsquo;s no noticeable delay. But when I plug in &lt;code>600851475143&lt;/code> the program just seems to freeze. What gives? Even after waiting five minutes the program is just sitting there. What&amp;rsquo;s happening?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tinkering-and-timing">Tinkering and timing&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s keep the logic of the program the same and play around with inputs to see if we get any hints about what the problem is. Remember I&amp;rsquo;m still using a magic &lt;code>is_prime()&lt;/code> function that we&amp;rsquo;ll get to below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here we refactor our program into a function to make it easier to call repeatedly on different inputs:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">def largest_prime_factor(n):
factors = []
for x in range(2, n):
if is_prime(x):
if n % x == 0:
factors.append(x)
return factors[-1]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now we can easily run that code with multiple inputs:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python-repl">&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; largest_prime_factor(13195)
29
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; largest_prime_factor(21952)
7
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; largest_prime_factor(98989)
8999
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>On my laptop, those first two examples seemed to run instantaneously, but the third one had a noticeable delay. Let&amp;rsquo;s measure how long the program takes to run every time we run it. We&amp;rsquo;ll use a simple way to time our code. There are of course, much
&lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7370801/measure-time-elapsed-in-python" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more accurate ways&lt;/a> to measure performance that are well suited for real-world profiling, but this is good enough for us right now.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">import time
def timed (n):
start = time.clock()
result = largest_prime_factor(n)
end = time.clock()
duration = end - start
print('Largest prime factor of {} is {}. Execution: {} seconds'.format(
n, result, duration
))
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now we can see how fast the code is running:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python-repl">&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; timed(13195)
&amp;quot;Largest prime factor of 13195 is 29. Execution: 0.018383000000000038 seconds&amp;quot;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; timed(21952)
&amp;quot;Largest prime factor of 21952 is 7. Execution: 0.026741000000015447 seconds&amp;quot;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; timed(98989)
&amp;quot;Largest prime factor of 98989 is 8999. Execution: 0.13390699999999356 seconds&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Of course, all these numbers are specific to my computer and setup. They&amp;rsquo;ll fluctuate a little each time I run the code, and they&amp;rsquo;ll also change depending on what else my computer is doing and several other factors. So if you run this you&amp;rsquo;ll get different numbers. That&amp;rsquo;s ok. The point is that I can easily see how &lt;em>execution time increases as I increase the size of the input&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That last part is important and bears repeating. &lt;em>Execution time increases as I increase the size of the input&lt;/em>. Bigger inputs take more time to process. Thinking about the &lt;code>for&lt;/code> loop in our &lt;code>largest_prime_factor&lt;/code> function it makes a lot of sense: the more we loop the longer our program takes to run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s start adding zeros to our input and see what happens:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python-repl">&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; timed(10000)
&amp;quot;Largest prime factor of 10000 is 5. Execution: 0.01425699999998642 seconds&amp;quot;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; timed(100000)
&amp;quot;Largest prime factor of 100000 is 5. Execution: 0.13481099999998492 seconds&amp;quot;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; timed(1000000)
&amp;quot;Largest prime factor of 1000000 is 5. Execution: 2.938510000000008 seconds&amp;quot;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; timed(10000000)
&amp;quot;Largest prime factor of 10000000 is 5. Execution: 74.51557199999999 seconds&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Uuuugh, that last one was a pain to wait for. And the rules of Project Euler say that solutions should run in a minute or less so that&amp;rsquo;s no good. Every time we add a zero to our input the code takes at least 10 times longer to run. The input we need to solve for, &lt;code>600851475143&lt;/code>, has 4 more digits than the number that took 74 seconds to solve. Back of the napkin, running our program on it will take something like $ 74 * 10^4 = 740{,}000 $ seconds to run. That&amp;rsquo;s 8 or 9 days. No good.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="correct-isnt-good-enough">Correct isn&amp;rsquo;t Good Enough&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If we&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em>actually going to solve this&lt;/em> we need a better &amp;ldquo;solution&amp;rdquo;. It isn&amp;rsquo;t good enough that our solution is correct. The solution above is correct. But we don&amp;rsquo;t have the resources to actually run it on the input we need to so it&amp;rsquo;s as good as useless. In our context, the naive solution &lt;em>really is naive&lt;/em>: it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take into account critical resource limitations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Computer cycles are &lt;em>cheap&lt;/em>. But they aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>free&lt;/em>. Give or take, my 2017 Macbook Air can run a simple python loop about $ 10{,}000{,}000 $ times in a second. That&amp;rsquo;s:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>$ \approx 1 * 10^7 $ loops in a second&lt;/li>
&lt;li>$ \approx 1 * 10^{14} $ loops in a year&lt;/li>
&lt;li>$ \approx 1 * 10^{16} $ loops in a &lt;strong>lifetime&lt;/strong> (~80 years)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Viewed through the lens of a human life, burning a million &amp;ldquo;Macbook loops&amp;rdquo; of time here or there doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. But my computing resources &lt;em>are&lt;/em> limited. As the exponent on a program&amp;rsquo;s computational needs increases that starts to matter more and more and &lt;em>more&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can refactor our &lt;em>correct&lt;/em> code into an actual, pragmatic &lt;em>solution&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="correct-_and_-efficient">Correct &lt;em>and&lt;/em> Efficient&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Ok, so life is to short for programs that loop &lt;code>600851475143&lt;/code> times. How can we find the factors of a number without needing so many loops?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key insight for this problem is to see that factors come in pairs. Take an easy number like $ 2{,}500 $. We can see right away that $ 2 $ is a factor:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ 2{,}500 / 2 = 1{,}250 $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hey look at that, we got another factor for free! If we see that $ 2 $ is a factor we can deduce that $ 1,250 $ &lt;em>must also&lt;/em> be a factor. Let&amp;rsquo;s do this a few more times and see if any patterns stand out:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ 2{,}500 / 5 = 500 $$
$$ 2{,}500 / 10 = 250 $$
$$ 2{,}500 / 20 = 125 $$
$$ 2{,}500 / 25 = 100 $$
$$ 2{,}500 / 50 = 50 $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As one factor gets larger it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;pair&amp;rdquo; factor gets smaller and smaller. Until they meet. Where do they meet? At the square root: $ \sqrt(2{,}500) $ is $ 50 $. That means every factor of $ n $ &lt;strong>larger&lt;/strong> than $ \sqrt(n) $ is paired with a factor &lt;strong>smaller&lt;/strong> than $ \sqrt(n) $. And so: we can find every factor of $ n $ just by looking at the integers up to $ \sqrt(n) $!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can use this to improve our solution. Instead of looping every number below &lt;code>600851475143&lt;/code> to find factors we can just loop over every integer below its square root: about &lt;code>775146&lt;/code>. That&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; &lt;em>a lot&lt;/em> fewer loops. In code:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">import math
def largest_prime_factor(n):
factors = []
for x in range(2, math.floor(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
if is_prime(x):
if n % x == 0:
pair = n / x
factors.append(x)
if is_prime(pair):
factors.append(pair)
return sorted(factors)[-1]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Ok, let&amp;rsquo;s check against our test input to see if it works:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python-repl">&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; largest_prime_factor(13195)
29
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Yep, still works. How fast?&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python-repl">&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; timed(13195)
&amp;quot;Largest prime factor of 13195 is 29. Execution: 0.0001859999999851425 seconds&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Hey, that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>a lot&lt;/em> faster than our naive solution. Is this good enough?&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python-repl">&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; timed(600851475143)
&amp;quot;Largest prime factor of 600851475143 is [censored]. Execution: 2.0993389999999863 seconds&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Woohoo!&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="the-is_prime-function-finally">The &lt;code>is_prime()&lt;/code> Function, Finally&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Ok so up till now I&amp;rsquo;ve asked you to just accept that we have a good &lt;code>is_prime()&lt;/code> function. Let&amp;rsquo;s dig into that. A prime is a number that is divisible only by 1 and itself. That is: it has no factors. And hey, we&amp;rsquo;ve already written code to find factors! Let&amp;rsquo;s repurpose that for our &lt;code>is_prime()&lt;/code> function:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">def is_prime(n):
for x in range(2, n):
if n % x == 0:
return False
return True
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If you squint at this function you&amp;rsquo;ll see it&amp;rsquo;s wolfing down compute and running more loops than we need just like our initial solution code was. Let&amp;rsquo;s use the same insight about only needing to search for factors up to the square root to improve things:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">def is_prime(n):
for x in range(2, math.floor(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
if n % x == 0:
return False
return True
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>And there we go: we have an &lt;code>is_prime()&lt;/code> function good enough to solve this problem. Are there ways to improve it? Yes, and we might look into that later if needed for harder problems, but in the spirit of pragmatism we&amp;rsquo;ll stick with this straightforward solution for as long as it does what we need it to do.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Project Euler Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers</title><link>/post/euler_problem_2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2020 15:13:26 -0700</pubDate><guid>/post/euler_problem_2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Our first, and certainly not our last, encounter with the Fibonacci Sequence on Project Euler.

&lt;h2 id="the-straightforward-approach">The Straightforward Approach&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The most straightforward way to solve this problem is to generate every Fibonacci number below four million, then look at each one, check whether it&amp;rsquo;s even and add it to our total if it is:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">fibs = [1, 1]
while fibs[-1] + fibs[-2] &amp;lt; 4000000:
fibs.append(fibs[-1] + fibs[-2])
evens = []
for n in fibs:
if n % 2 == 0:
evens.append(n)
print(sum(evens))
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="saving-some-memory">Saving Some Memory&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The solution above works and runs plenty quick. We don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>need&lt;/em> to simplify. But &lt;em>can&lt;/em> we? You might notice that we&amp;rsquo;re creating a pretty big list of fibonacci numbers. Is there a way we can avoid using all that memory? What if, instead of a list, we just kept track of the two most recent numbers and checked for evenness at the same time we generate each new number?&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">result = 0
a = 1
b = 1
while a + b &amp;lt; 4000000:
next = a + b
a = b
b = next
if b % 2 == 0:
result += b
print(result)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="saving-some-lines">Saving Some Lines&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Mathematicians and programmers coming from other languages might get weirded out by an amazing Python feature called &lt;strong>multiple assignment&lt;/strong>. It lets us do things like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">x = 'ham'
y = 'eggs'
x, y = y, x
print(x)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 'eggs'
print(y)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 'ham'
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Multiple assignment lets us swap two variables in a single line and do other fun things with assigning to more than one variable at a time. Check out how we can use multiple assignment to compress our solution above in two places:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">result = 0
a, b = 1, 1
while a + b &amp;lt; 4000000:
a, b = b, a + b
if b % 2 == 0:
result += b
print(result)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This is super useful and can make for much more concise code. Trey Hunter has a great

&lt;h2 id="skipping-odds">Skipping Odds&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In our solutions so far we&amp;rsquo;ve been calculating every fibonacci number and then checking if it&amp;rsquo;s even. What if we could just skip the fibonacci numbers we don&amp;rsquo;t want and just calculate the ones we need?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Look at the sequence below. Do you see a pattern with even numbers?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1, 1, &lt;strong>2&lt;/strong>, 3, 5, &lt;strong>8&lt;/strong>, 13, 21, &lt;strong>34&lt;/strong>, 55, 89, &amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every third term in the sample above is even. Can you see why it&amp;rsquo;s not just a coincidence and is true for the entire sequence?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is there a way to calculate &lt;em>only&lt;/em> the 3rd, 6th, 9th, etc. items so we don&amp;rsquo;t waste precious CPU cycles on lame odd numbers like &lt;code>89&lt;/code>? Yes.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-he-must-have-used-more-compute-than-absolutely-necessary">
&lt;img src="/img/computer_fire.gif" alt="" >
&lt;figcaption>
He must have used more compute than absolutely necessary
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I won&amp;rsquo;t run through the steps here, but you can start with the fibonacci series definition:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ F_{n} = {\color{#FF007F}F_{n-2}} + \color{#0072BB}F_{n-1} $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>where $ F_{n} $ is the nth term in the sequence, and algebraically derive the equation:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ F_{n} = {\color{#FF007F}F_{n-6}} + {\color{#0072BB}F_{n-3}} + {\color{#177245}(3 * F_{n-3})} $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So normally to get the next term we add the previous two terms. For the next &lt;em>even&lt;/em> term we add the previous two &lt;em>even&lt;/em> terms, and then add the previous even term three more times. In code:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python"># Seed with first two even terms.
a, b = 2, 8
result = 10
while a + 4 * b &amp;lt; 4000000:
a, b = b, a + b + (3 * b)
result += b
print(result)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s always nice when a more optimal algorithm &lt;em>also&lt;/em> makes for less code. However, we&amp;rsquo;ve lost some clarity compared to our previous solutions. It&amp;rsquo;s not clear from the code itself where the hard-coded &lt;strong>magic numbers&lt;/strong> &lt;code>2&lt;/code>, &lt;code>8&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>10&lt;/code> are coming from.
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_%28programming%29#Unnamed_numerical_constants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magic numbers&lt;/a> aren&amp;rsquo;t self-explanatory in the way named variables are and they can make a program harder to understand and maintain. That&amp;rsquo;s why I added a comment at the top: I did&amp;rsquo;t think the code alone made it obvious enough to you what it was doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-golden-solution">A Golden Solution&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s get &lt;em>real&lt;/em> funky with it. Is there a way to calculate each term directly from the single term before it? For example, how could we look at $ 34 $ and calculate $ 55 $ without knowing or caring that the previous term was 21?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our buddy Fibonacci discovered way back in 1202 that the ratio between successive terms in the fibonacci sequence converges on $ \phi $, the &lt;strong>golden ratio&lt;/strong>. So if you take $ F_n $ and multiply it by $ \phi $ you get alllllmost $ F_{n+1} $. Using the example above you get:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ 34 * \phi = 55.0131556175&amp;hellip; $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>super&lt;/em> close to the right answer: $ 55 $.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Multiply by $ \phi $ again and you get $ \approx{89} $, and multiply by $ \phi $ one last time to get $ \approx{144} $. Each time we multiply by $ \phi $ we step to the next fibonacci number. We can take three steps at once by multiplying by $ \phi^3 $. More formally:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ F_{n+3} \approx F_{n} * \phi^3 $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ok this trick gets us an &lt;em>approximate&lt;/em> answer, but how do we turn that into an &lt;em>exact&lt;/em> answer? It turns out the approximation is so good and the error so small that you can just round the result to the nearest integer. That&amp;rsquo;s it:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ F_{n+3} = \|(F_{n} * \phi^3)\| $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s code that up:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python"># Define phi because it isn't predifined in the Python standard library.
phi = (1 + 5 ** 0.5) / 2
a = result = 2
while a * phi ** 3 &amp;lt; 4000000:
a = round(a * phi ** 3)
result += a
print(result)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now ain&amp;rsquo;t that a shiny solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="analytic-approximation-not-solution">Analytic Approximation (not Solution)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is a nice solution but it still relies on a &lt;code>while&lt;/code> loop to calculate items one by one. I can almost, but not &lt;em>quite&lt;/em> get to a direct calculation. The approximation of $ \phi $, which was small enough between terms to round away in the solution above, compounds in this stab at an analytic solution and so only gives an approximation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the specific problem inputs this gives a result about 5% off from the true answer. Here&amp;rsquo;s my approximation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we ignore rounding for now, we can write out the sequence of terms we generate above like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ 2,\: 2\phi^3,\: 2\phi^6,\: 2\phi^9,\: 2\phi^{12},\: &amp;hellip; $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you squint real hard, you can see that&amp;rsquo;s a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geometric series&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to see if we replace $ \phi^3 $ with the symbol $ r $:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ 2r^0,\: 2r^1,\: 2r^2,\: 2r^3,\: 2r^4,\: &amp;hellip; $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>where $ r = \phi^3 \approx{4.2360679775} $&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since this is a geometric series we can use the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_progression#Geometric_series" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formula&lt;/a> for the sum of the first $ n $ terms of a geometric series:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ Geometric{\ }Sum = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1 - r} $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where $ a $ is the start term (in our case: $ 2 $), $ r $ is the ratio between terms (in our case $ \phi^3 $ or about $ 4.2360679775 $), and $ n $ is the number of terms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All we&amp;rsquo;re missing now is $ n $. We can get that by taking the log base $ r $ of our limit (spoiler: it&amp;rsquo;s $ 11 $). Let&amp;rsquo;s code it up:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">import math
phi = (1 + 5 ** 0.5) / 2
r = phi ** 3
a = 2
n = 11
print((a * (1 - r ** n)) / (1 - r))
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Unfortunately the approximations, which were small enough to ignore last time, are now compounding. This attempt overshoots the right answer by about 5%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether there&amp;rsquo;s a way to improve the accuracy of this approach or if there&amp;rsquo;s a way to tweak it to sidestep the approximation issues.

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz#Programming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fizzbuzz&lt;/a>! What a great way to dive in.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="who-is-this-for">Who is this for?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A quick note: this series of posts is meant for people who already have a development environment set up and are familiar with the very basics of Python. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never written a line of Python before I recommend
&lt;a href="https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Camp&amp;rsquo;s Python introduction&lt;/a> or another free Python 3 tutorial that covers the basics of &lt;strong>variables&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>basic types&lt;/strong> (ints, floats, strings, booleans), &lt;strong>operations&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>lists&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>dictionaries&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>functions&lt;/strong>. If you&amp;rsquo;re an experienced programmer but new to Python check out the &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo;
&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python Tutorial&lt;/a>. And if you&amp;rsquo;re comfy writing Python but don&amp;rsquo;t have a good local development environment set up yet check out
&lt;a href="/">Problem 0: Getting Started&lt;/a> [TODO].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, this is meant for people who enjoy solving or reading about
&lt;a href="projecteuler.net">Project Euler&lt;/a> problems. PE has this to say about sharing solutions:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We hope that you enjoyed solving this problem. Please do not deprive others of going through the same process by publishing your solution outside of Project Euler. Members found to be spoiling problems beyond #100 will have their accounts locked (see note).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: The rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first 100 problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material and if you are able to respect our requirements, then we give permission for them to be discussed elsewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I take PE&amp;rsquo;s requirements about sharing information seriously and hope you will too. I love that so much of the programming world happens in the open with public repos and such, but you won&amp;rsquo;t find my work on problems 101+ here, on GitHub, or anywhere else public.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-problem">The Problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Ok, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about threes and fives. Before we analyze it together,
&lt;a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take a few minutes alone with Problem 1&lt;/a>. Set up a Project Euler account if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already. Consider how you &lt;em>might&lt;/em> solve it. Take a stab at writing a solution before moving on. I&amp;rsquo;ll wait.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="iterative-solutions">Iterative Solutions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Great, you&amp;rsquo;re back. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in. The most straightforward way to solve this problem is to look at every number from one to a thousand, test whether it&amp;rsquo;s divisible by 3 or 5, and add it to our running total if it is:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">result = 0
integers = range(1, 1000)
for x in integers:
if x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0:
result += x
print(result)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>In this solution we initialize our result to &lt;code>0&lt;/code>, use a &lt;code>for&lt;/code> loop to iterate over every integer from &lt;code>1&lt;/code> through &lt;code>1000&lt;/code>, test whether it&amp;rsquo;s divisible by &lt;code>3&lt;/code> or &lt;code>5&lt;/code> using the modulo operator (&lt;code>%&lt;/code>) and add it to our &lt;code>result&lt;/code> variable if it is. Bam.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="using-list-comprehensions">Using List Comprehensions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">List comprehensions&lt;/a> can be an elegant and &amp;ldquo;pythonic&amp;rdquo; way to solve problems. Here&amp;rsquo;s the same iterative solution above using a list comprehension rather than a loop.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">print(sum([x for x in range(1, 1000) if x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0]))
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now isn&amp;rsquo;t that short and sweet. I love list comprehensions. They can get ugly fast, and it&amp;rsquo;s possible to overuse them, but comprehensions excel in cases like this where you can express a few lines of procedural code as a single thought.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-more-functional-approach">A More Functional Approach&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Python isn&amp;rsquo;t known for being a naturally functional language, but it&amp;rsquo;s certainly possible to use it that way. You can use &lt;code>filter()&lt;/code> in place of the comprehension above:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">print(sum(filter(lambda x: x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0, range(1, 1000))))
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Looking at this approach next to the comprehension above it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see why the comprehension is more idiomatic: it just reads easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course it&amp;rsquo;s no fun to talk about functional programming without contorting &lt;code>reduce()&lt;/code> into a solution:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">from functools import reduce
print(reduce(
lambda x, y: x + y if y % 3 == 0 or y % 5 == 0 else x,
range(1, 1000),
0
))
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>With Python 3 &lt;code>reduce()&lt;/code> is no longer a built-in function and instead needs to be imported from the &lt;code>functools&lt;/code> library. That makes me sad. I can understand why (a comprehension is &lt;em>almost&lt;/em> always more practical), but speaking as an apostle of
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl98eZpkp-c&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;em>Reduce, God of Parentheses&lt;/em>&lt;/a> I have to say I miss having it an my fingertips.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="analytic-solution">Analytic solution&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The iterative solutions above all rely on generating a list of integers, checking them one by one, and adding them up. That works just fine when you&amp;rsquo;re only counting to a thousand and you have modern computing resources at your fingertips. But things aren&amp;rsquo;t always so easy. What if we were solving this for all integers up to a quadrillion? What if we were working in an environment with limited memory or compute? What if we needed to run this solution gajillions of times every second?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might have heard a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss#Anecdotes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">famous anecdote about Gauss&lt;/a> and how as a young kid he summed the numbers from 1 to 100 in just a few seconds. He didn&amp;rsquo;t actually add all the numbers together, he recognized a pattern in the arithmetic progression 1, 2, 3, &amp;hellip; 99, 100 and used a formula instead. Specifically, you can &amp;ldquo;fold&amp;rdquo; the sequence and match pairs like 1 + 100, 2 + 99, 3 + 98, &amp;hellip; 49 + 52, 50 + 51. There are exactly 50 such pairs and each pair equals 101, so the total sum is 101 * 50 = 5,050.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This approach works with &lt;em>any&lt;/em> arithmetic progression. We could sum all multiples of 5 below a hundred by &amp;ldquo;folding&amp;rdquo; the sequence 5, 10, 15, &amp;hellip; 95, 100 and getting 10 pairs that equal 105 for a total sum of 1,050.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In general, the formula to calculate the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression#Sum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sum of an arithmetic progression&lt;/a> is: &lt;code>number_of_terms * (first_term + last_term) / 2&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How does this apply to our fizzbuzz problem? The integers we&amp;rsquo;re summing don&amp;rsquo;t form a nice arithmetic progression. And we can&amp;rsquo;t just add the sum of multiples of three to the sum of multiples of five, because that would double-count numbers like 15 and 30. And 45. And 60. See a pattern?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The trick is in recognizing that we&amp;rsquo;re dealing with &lt;em>three&lt;/em> arithmetic progressions. If we want the sum of all numbers that are a multiple of three &lt;em>or&lt;/em> a multiple of five, we can find that by adding &lt;code>sum(multiples_of_three&lt;/code> to &lt;code>sum(multiples_of_five)&lt;/code> and then &lt;em>subtracting&lt;/em> &lt;code>sum(multiples_of_fifteen)&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-python">def simple_arithmetic_series(step, limit):
first = step
count = (limit - 1) // step
last = step * count
return count * (first + last) / 2
multiples_of_3 = simple_arithmetic_series(3, 1000)
multiples_of_5 = simple_arithmetic_series(5, 1000)
multiples_of_15 = simple_arithmetic_series(15, 1000)
print(multiples_of_3 + multiples_of_5 - multiples_of_15)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h1 id="evil-optimization">Evil optimization&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The analytic solution involves a lot more typing and it isn&amp;rsquo;t as simple to read and understand, so why is it better?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, it &lt;em>isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em> better. There are tradeoffs between the analytic solution and the iterative solution. Neither is inherently better. Deciding which approach is better for you depends on your context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the context of this specific problem, &lt;em>the iterative solution works just fine&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s faster to conceive and implement, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to understand, and less code is less chance for things to break. With our crazy strong computers and the small numbers involved the analytic solution is just a bunch of optimization that was (maybe) fun to do but doesn&amp;rsquo;t buy us anything valuable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is an example of &lt;strong>premature optimization&lt;/strong>, and as Donald Knuth famously said, &amp;ldquo;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization#When_to_optimize" target="_blank" rel="noopener">premature optimization is the root of all evil&lt;/a>&amp;quot;. Spending time optimizing things we don&amp;rsquo;t need to isn&amp;rsquo;t just a waste of time better spent elsewhere, it also makes our programs worse: harder to understand and maintain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That said, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to think of cases where the tradeoffs might play out the other way. What if we were working with much larger numbers? Try plugging in bigger numbers to the iterative and analytic solutions and watch where the difference in performance starts to get noticeable. My laptop struggles to run the iterative solution above about a hundred million. Even the world&amp;rsquo;s biggest supercomputer,
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_%28supercomputer%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summit&lt;/a> doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough memory to store a list of all integers up to a quadrillion. But my dinky laptop can calculate &lt;code>simple_arithmetic_series(3, 1000000000000000)&lt;/code> with no noticeable delay. With the right algorithm, my laptop can do something that&amp;rsquo;s literally impossible for the world&amp;rsquo;s best supercomputer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those numbers seem ridiculous but spoiler alert: Project Euler is going to start throwing hefty numbers at us pretty quick. As we dig deeper performance, resources, and
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">computational complexity&lt;/a> are going to get critically important.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>❤️ Project Euler</title><link>/post/heart_euler/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2020 23:54:43 -0700</pubDate><guid>/post/heart_euler/</guid><description>&lt;p>In 2012 I was a corporate lawyer at a big fancy firm. If you&amp;rsquo;d seen teenage me or college me you&amp;rsquo;d be understandably confused. Grae somehow ended up a lawyer? A corporate lawyer at a fancy firm? What? And if you know me today you might be similarly confused.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My life as a corporate lawyer was short in part because of Project Euler.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That winter Kelly, a law school classmate, shared an article with a group of us about this crazy new company called Dev Bootcamp. It trained people to be programmers. And actually got them jobs! Good ones!&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-dbc-launched-the-coding-bootcamp-industry">

DBC launched the coding bootcamp industry.
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>By then we were starting our second year of practice. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a great time. Graduating into the great recession meant a lot of us couldn&amp;rsquo;t land a firm job. And those who &lt;em>did&lt;/em> get hired were dealing with the tough reality of law firm life. A bunch of us had the same thought when we learned about coding bootcamps: &amp;ldquo;Holy shit, I wish this was a thing four years ago when I made the naive decision to go to law school.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-aww-poor-white-collar-professional-photo-credit-ethan-sykes-on-unsplash">

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Most of the people who &lt;em>would have&lt;/em> done a bootcamp instead of law school couldn&amp;rsquo;t stomach eating the sunk cost to change careers. I was lucky: Stassia saw how unsatisfied I was. She said &amp;ldquo;If you aren&amp;rsquo;t happy you should quit; we&amp;rsquo;ll figure it out.&amp;rdquo; She&amp;rsquo;s done a lot of amazing things for me over the years, but giving me permission &amp;amp; encouragement to abandon a lucrative career is near the top of the list. She was still several years of training away from starting her own and mine was the only income. It was risky, but with her support I left biglaw.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tuition at DBC was I think like $12k. That&amp;rsquo;s a tiny fraction of the cost of my JD. Still, with my student debt and monthly loan payments we didn&amp;rsquo;t have the reserves or cashflow for that. So what could I do?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Casting about the web for low cost options I ran into Hacker School (now
&lt;a href="https://www.recurse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recurse Center&lt;/a>). Seemed like a cool opportunity. Price was right. But I wasn&amp;rsquo;t qualified yet. I knew I didn&amp;rsquo;t have anywhere near enough programming experience to apply, but how much &lt;em>was&lt;/em> enough? I checked
&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130115173024/https://www.hackerschool.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their FAQ&lt;/a> and that&amp;rsquo;s where I found it:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How much programming experience do I need for Hacker School?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;hellip; solve
&lt;a href="http://projecteuler.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Euler&lt;/a> problems for fun&amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;re almost certainly a good fit for Hacker School.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Huh. Project Euler. What&amp;rsquo;s that? &lt;em>Click&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I got hooked right away. Hooked bad. Being newly unemployed I spent my spring at The Wormhole drinking coffee and teaching myself Python by solving Project Euler problems. They scratched an itch I forgot I had. They were frustrating and impossible and clever and solving one felt &lt;em>amazing&lt;/em>. That silly green checkmark became the best part of my day.&lt;/p>

You&amp;rsquo;re good enough, you&amp;rsquo;re smart enough, and doggone it, people like you!

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>By the time I interviewed at Thinkful I&amp;rsquo;d solved about 80 problems, averaging a solution every day or two, though some took much longer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Project Euler had a big impact on my work and my life. It made me excited to write code. It gave me the motivation to keep beating my head against the wall while I was learning. It lent me credibility during my interviews and helped me join Thinkful, where I successfully pivoted into tech and got paid to help others do the same. It drilled me, without me realizing, in data structures and algorithmic complexity before I knew what those were. And it reminded me how much I love math.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I want to talk about it here. I&amp;rsquo;ve held off on sharing my solutions or analysis because, well, Project Euler asked me not to. But now they let people talk about the first hundred problems. So let&amp;rsquo;s dive in and see how many of those we can cover.&lt;/p>
